If you have a Xolo Era 2 smartphone with a SC9832 chipset and Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system, you may encounter a problem where the phone gets stuck on the logo screen and does not boot up. This can be caused by a corrupted firmware, a faulty hardware component, or a malicious software attack. In this article, we will show you how to fix this problem by flashing a new firmware file on your Xolo Era 2 device.
 
## What is Firmware and Why Do You Need It?
 
Firmware is a software program that controls the basic functions of a device, such as booting up, communicating with other components, and performing tasks. Firmware is stored in a non-volatile memory chip inside the device, which means it does not get erased when the device is turned off. Firmware can be updated by the manufacturer or the user to improve performance, fix bugs, or add new features.

However, sometimes firmware can get corrupted due to various reasons, such as power failure, virus infection, improper installation, or physical damage. When this happens, the device may not work properly or at all. For example, if the firmware of your Xolo Era 2 phone is corrupted, it may not be able to load the operating system and get stuck on the logo screen. To fix this problem, you need to flash a new firmware file on your phone using a computer and a USB cable.
 
## How to Flash Xolo Era 2 Flash File SC9832 6.0 Firmware
 
Before you flash a new firmware file on your Xolo Era 2 phone, you need to back up your data, such as contacts, messages, photos, videos, and apps.
